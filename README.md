# ChatApp
Simple implementation of a chat app with a GUI using the java programming language <br>
# Architecture
This chat app is built on a simple concept, to connect the server to the user and exchange messages. In the case of 2 or more clients, this chat app would become a group chat more than a private one-to-one communication platform.<br>
# Instructions on how to operate software
Operating the software is pretty straight-forward, starting the server first and then starting the client.<br>
